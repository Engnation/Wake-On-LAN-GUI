# Wake-On-LAN-GUI
This repository contains a Python application that can be used to wake a PC by sending a magic packet.

The GUI portion of this application is not currently functional but is intended to add future functionality to allow the user to invoke the wake command and provide user feedback that a magic packet has been sent.
